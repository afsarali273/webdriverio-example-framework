Feature: Shopping Basket

  As a user of the NAP website
  I would like to be able to add products to my shopping basket
  So that I can order one or more products at a time

  Scenario: User is able to add a single product to their basket
    Given I am on the NAP Homepage
    Then I can check out the contents of my basket
