Feature: Chrome on Android

  As a user of the NAP website
  I would like to be able to shop on the site using Chrome on my Android mobile device
  So that I might purchase products

  Scenario: Visit the NAP site using Chrome on Android
    Given I visit the Net-a-porter website
    Then I am able to verify that Chrome is launched on Android
